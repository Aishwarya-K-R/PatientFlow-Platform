🚀 **PatientFlow Platform : Scalable Cloud-Native Microservices for Healthcare Ops**  

📌 **Overview**  
**PatientFlow Platform** is a **cloud-native, microservices-based healthcare backend system** designed to manage patient operations efficiently and scalably.  

The platform demonstrates **real-world production architecture patterns** including:  
- Microservices architecture  
- Event-driven communication  
- API Gateway pattern  
- Observability & monitoring  
- CI/CD automation  
- Containerization & orchestration  

It is built to simulate how modern healthcare platforms **handle patient data, authentication, billing, and system communication at scale.**

🔧 **Core Components**  
**1. API Gateway:**  
- Central entry point for all client requests  
- Handles routing, aggregation, rate limiting and health checks  
**2. Microservices:**  
- **Auth Service** → Authentication & authorization  
- **Patient Service** → Patient data management  
- **Billing Service** → Billing and transactions  
**3. Communication Layer:**  
- **gRPC** → Fast synchronous communication between services  
- **Kafka** → Event-driven asynchronous messaging  
**4. Data Layer:**  
- **PostgreSQL** → Persistent storage  
- **Redis** → Caching and fast data access  
**5. Observability:**  
- **Prometheus** → Metrics collection  
- **Grafana** → Visualization dashboards  
**6. DevOps & Deployment:**  
- **Docker** → Containerization  
- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)** → Automated build & push  
- **Kubernetes (Manifests)** → Orchestration-ready setup

⚙️ **System Functionality**  
The platform simulates a real healthcare workflow:
1. User authentication using **JWT-based RBAC** via Auth Service  
2. Patient data creation and retrieval  
3. Billing operations triggered via events  
4. Services communication:
- **Sync → gRPC**  
- **Async → Kafka**  
5. **API Gateway** routes all **external requests and handles rate limiting**
6. **Health checks** ensure service availability
7. **Metrics** are exposed and monitored in real-time via **Prometheus and Grafana**

🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**  
The project includes a fully automated pipeline:
**1. Workflow:**  
- Code pushed to repository  
- GitHub Actions triggers pipeline  
- Docker images built for each service  
- Images pushed to Docker Hub  
**2. Outcome:**  
- Ready-to-deploy container images  
- Consistent and automated builds

**☸️ Kubernetes Support**  
Kubernetes manifests are included for all services.
⚠️ **Note:**  
- Full deployment may fail on low-resource systems (e.g., Minikube) due to memory limits.
- Its recommended to deploy on a cloud Kubernetes cluster for full setup.

🛠️ **Steps for Implementation**  
1. Clone Repository:  
- git clone **https://github.com/Aishwarya-K-R/PatientFlow-Platform.git**
- cd PatientFlow-Platform
2. Create **.env** file in the project root and provide the data required for **docker-compose.yml** file
3. For Kubernetes setup, provide the required data in **secrets.yml and config-map.yml** files
4. Run with Docker Compose: **docker-compose up --build**
5. Run Kubernetes (based on the setup): **kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/**  
6. Access the services:
- **API Gateway:** http://localhost:4004/  
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:4004/health  
- **Kafka UI:** http://localhost:8080  
- **Prometheus:** http://localhost:9090  
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:3000
